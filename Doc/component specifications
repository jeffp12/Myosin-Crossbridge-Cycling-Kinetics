## WHO ARE THE USERS AND THEIR BACKGROUND
This tool will be applicable to those with a background in biochemistry, specifically those in the fields of muscle biology research.
  - This applies to both cardiac and skeletal muscle specialists. 
  - Users are interested in using this as a model of how alterations in biochemical mechanisms/parameters 
    (perhaps due to mutations) can reflect in 2D visualization

## WHAT INFORMATION USERS WANT FROM TOOL
This tool can help probe how changes in protein concentration/ availability, equilibrium rates, and ATP can create response rates.
  - This could be used in parallel with clinical data in hopes of response curves matching with disease phenotypes 
    for ex// hypercontractility would perhaps show slower myosin release (larger slope)
The calculated rate over a short time period (on the scale of milliseconds - seconds)

## USE CASES
- Calculates the slopes in varying enzymatic reactions with differing concentrations over time
- Create a dose-response curve for myosin targeted therapies that effect myosin activation, constant rates, etc. 
- Creates a 2 2-dimensional plot for each specialized parameter model run. This can be done by altering constants and pushing 
  concentrations togetherr
