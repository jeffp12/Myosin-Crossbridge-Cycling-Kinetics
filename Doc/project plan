# This will outline my workflow and the milestones I hope to reach for the rest of the quarter:

# (11/04/2024 - 11/08/2024): Software Project Outline with Comp and Func Specifications

# (11/11/2024 - 11/15/2024): 
  Search in the literature for enzyme kinetics of the major steps of the Cross Bridge Cycle and translate them into Python. 
  Collect and implement all the visualization and computing packages necessary
    - Numpy 
    - MATplot
    - More to be used
 
# (11/18/2024 - 11/22/2024): 
  Do initial runs and tests to make sure the code is able to produce a graph with the desired outputs/ measurements
  Upscale this to include the minimum of 5 enzymatic reactions taking place during a contraction
  Acquire and implement biomedical rates to model
