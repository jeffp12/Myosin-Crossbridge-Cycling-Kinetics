Background:
As mentioned in the project description, the biochemical and biomechanical process of cross-bridge cycling is essential for mammalian life. 
Mutations in sarcomeric protein disrupt this cycle in different aspects and I am curious to see if I can create a visualization to capture 
the differences this causes in enzyme kinetics with and without treatment. 

This will require me to accomplish the following aims:

1) I will create and tailor a mathematical model that drives cross-bridge kinetics. This will be done by adapting established equations published
in the field. Additionally, my mathematical model will follow human-derived kinetics. This portion of the program will be made to be easily
adjusted by the audience to match their desired experimental conditions. This will be done using Tellerium to outline the kinetics and Numpy
to calculate numerical derivatives.

2) This aim focuses on visualization production of the crossbridge cycling kinetics. My aim is to make this graph, at the very least, an
informative 2D image with hopes of making it interactive. 

3) Lastly, as my research also adopts a translational aspect, I wanted this program to have a predictive modeling nature. I would like this to 
process, graph, and then report the significant changes when drug treatment is applied. This will be done using MATplotlib to visualize the 
slope alongside or on top of the rate response curve for easy comparison.
